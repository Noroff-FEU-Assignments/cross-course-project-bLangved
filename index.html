    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">
        <li>Ensuring that the data a system accepts is in the right format, and preventing user-inputs performing CRUD operations. </li> 
        <li> Ensuring that authorization and authentication are hard to crack by using secure two-factor authentication sliutions, such as Microsoft Authenticator, OneLogin etc, or other frameworks for securing passord/user security. </li> 
        <li>Be sure that the third-party software applications being used is to be trusted and throughout tested before using it. A rarely downloaded/used software might not be the most secure sliution.</li>
        <li>Using Continuous Deployment/Continuous Integration to run every change against some security checks, and decides the delivery of the change to productions. If the code does not pass the checks, it will ble flagged/rejected, and needs rework. </li>             <li>Automatic user timeout, so the used credentials don't hang in the browser for a long time. </li>
