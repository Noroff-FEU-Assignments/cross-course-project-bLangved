        <h1 class="h1_about">Many companies sell games.<br>Why don’t you?</H1>

        <p class="main_p1_about">GameHub is an all online game service, where users can purchase new, and sell their
            existing digital games.
            Have you ever bought a game, and realized you never actually played it? Maybe you have played through your
            favorite game way to many times, and figured it is time to move on to another. Why keep it?</p>
        <p class="main_p2_about">We know the feeling, and that’s what Game Hub is all about.</p>

        <h2 class="main_sub_title_about">How does it work?</h2>
        <p class="main_p3_about">Put your games out for sale, and we will automatically set a fair price based on
            the
            marked value of the game. When another user has bought your game, we will wire the money to your
            account.
            Game Hub takes a small fee for every game sold, but we fix everything for you. </p>
