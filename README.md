some motes have been made at the top of the CSS.Styles-document. 

There are some errors through validating, but nothing major imo. The site is working on both mobile and desktop, and there should be no horizontal scrollbars. 
Havent had enough time to do heavy bugfixing with developer-tools, but fixed some things. 

Maybe I havent been aware of all the information in the courses leading up to this one, but it would have been nice with a "heads up" 
that its better to keep it a bit more simple, since the amount of code and tweaks you need to do to get all your design working could be a big amount of work.
I was not aware at the beginning of the Design course, that we would be coding that up with HTML and CSS. I would have done some other design choices if that was the case. 

It's not all bad, and the amount I have learned through the assigment is huge!
